# Boston-Dynamics-Ultra-Micro-Spot-Desk-Pet-

This project started as a passion for robots and I wanted to make a little desk pet that I can program easily.
The moves are really limited due to the 4 servo setup and the development is really slow because I don't really have much free time,
so if you have suggestions or want to take part in the development feel free to edit the code.
