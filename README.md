# Boston-Dynamics-Ultra-Micro-Spot-Desk-Pet-
This project started as a passion for robots and I wanted to make a little desk pet that I can program easily.
The moves are really limited due to the 4 servo setup and the development is really slow because I don't really have much free time,
so if you have suggestions or want to take part in the development feel free to edit the code.

## You will need
-Wemos D1 mini
-Passive buzzer
-Microswitch
-Eachine E58 Drone battery (it has an integrated BMS and I had 5 lying around)
-4 pieces of 9gram servos(I used metal geared but you can use plastic geared)
-Soldering iron, wires, standard 1.54 pin headers
-Screwdriver
